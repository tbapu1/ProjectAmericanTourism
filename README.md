# Project American Tourism
Project American Tourism (PAT) is user-centric focused by placing the unique needs and preferences of each user at the very core of its design and functionality. Our dedication to user satisfaction is immediately apparent in PAT's core objective: to empower individuals seeking memorable tourism experiences within US cities by tailoring its vast array of resources and services to enhance their visits.

The user-centric philosophy underpinning PAT is most conspicuously reflected in the project's designed Entity-Relationship (ER) model. At its heart lies the "User" entity, a cornerstone of personalization. Attributes such as "Username," "Password," and "Email" enable the project to provide a personalized experience for each user, allowing them to create individual accounts, finely customize their preferences, and receive insightful recommendations based on their unique interests and past interactions. The inclusion of entities like "Events_Attended," "Events_Liked," and "Wishlist" further underscores PAT's commitment to aligning with user desires. Users can actively record and manage their interactions with events, effectively curating their tourism experiences based on their past choices. In essence, PAT is dedicated to user engagement, satisfaction, and autonomy, striving to make every exploration of US cities more meaningful, efficient, and tailored to individual preferences.

Moreover, the project's user-centricity is further accentuated by its unwavering focus on real-time interaction. By providing users with instant access to event details, event types, and comprehensive city information, PAT empowers its users to make informed decisions during their visits. This real-time aspect gives users the flexibility to adapt their plans on the fly, ensuring that they can make the most of their time exploring US cities. Furthermore, PAT fully embraces the importance of user feedback and preferences through its innovative "Events_Liked" and "Wishlist" features. These features allow users to actively express their preferences and desires, ultimately influencing the events and recommendations they receive, thus making PAT not just a passive resource but an interactive platform that adapts to and evolves with each user's journey. This interactive dimension underscores PAT's identity as a genuinely user-centric initiative that excels in enhancing the tourism experience within US cities.

In addition to its user-centric framework, PAT offers an expansive platform that serves as an invaluable resource for tourists, with multiple key functionalities. Users can effortlessly track their activities by adding events they've attended and liked, thereby creating a personalized record of their interests and past experiences. Each event is associated with a unique ID, providing detailed information that includes the event name, type, maximum occupancy, ticket price, description, and related attractions. These events are intrinsically linked to the city in which they occur, delivering crucial geographical context for users. The "City" entity is an essential component, offering vital information such as the city's name, nickname, population, and state, which is indispensable for efficient travel planning. Furthermore, attractions within the city are made more accessible through detailed descriptions, aiding users in making informed decisions about their priorities. Time slots provide essential scheduling details for attractions, including dates, start times, and end times, simplifying the planning process significantly. This multifaceted approach, supported by a well-structured ER model and database, empowers users with a wealth of insights into events, attractions, and the cities themselves, thereby significantly enhancing their overall tourism experience within the United States.
